Week 1 (2 hours): Data Structures & Core Logic
Theme: Build the foundation of the library system.
Learning Targets
•	Lists, tuples, dictionaries
•	Nested dictionaries
•	Functions with parameters & return values
•	Translating real-world rules into code
Tasks
Task 1 — Create the Library Catalogue
Each group builds a dictionary like:
catalogue = {
    "book_001": {"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "copies": 3},
    "book_002": {"title": "The Hobbit", "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien", "copies": 2},
    "book_003": {"title": "Python Basics", "author": "A. Smith", "copies": 5}
}
Task 2 — Membership Rules
Define rules as functions:
•	A member can borrow up to 3 books at once
•	Borrowing period = 14 days
•	Late fees = 50p per day after 14 days
Functions:
def borrowing_allowed(current_books):
    return current_books < 3

def calculate_late_fee(days_late):
    return days_late * 0.50
Task 3 — Book Availability Checker
def is_book_available(book_id):
    return catalogue[book_id]["copies"] > 0
End of Week 1 Deliverable
A module containing:
•	Full book catalogue
•	Membership rules
•	Availability checker
•	Fee calculation functions
Outcome:
Students master data structures + basic logic.
